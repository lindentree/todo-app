An incomplete todo list app built in the TDD paradigm with functional components and React Hooks.
Currently allows the user to add todos in ascending numerical order.

Todos:

1. Add ability to delete todos - [x]
2. Add ability to mark todos complete - [ ]
2. Persist todos in localStorage - [ ]

As a full stack application, individual users' todo lists would be stored in a database.
